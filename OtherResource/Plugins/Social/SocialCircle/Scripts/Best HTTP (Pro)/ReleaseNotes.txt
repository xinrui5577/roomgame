Starting in v1.9.0 there are many defines that can be used to disable a feature. These defines can be combined, even all can be set. Disabled features will not compile, so build size can be reduced by disabling unused features.
These defines are the following:
-BESTHTTP_DISABLE_COOKIES: With this define all cookie releated code can be disabled. No cookie parsing, saving and sending will occur.
-BESTHTTP_DISABLE_CACHING: With this define all cache releated code can be disabled. No caching, or cache validation will be done.
-BESTHTTP_DISABLE_SERVERSENT_EVENTS: Server-Sent Events can be disabled with this. SignalR will not fallback to this.
-BESTHTTP_DISABLE_WEBSOCKET: Websocket can be disable with this. SignalR and Socket.IO will not use this protocol.
-BESTHTTP_DISABLE_SIGNALR: The entire SignalR implementation will be disabled.
-BESTHTTP_DISABLE_SOCKETIO: The entire Socket.IO implementation will be disabled.
-BESTHTTP_DISABLE_ALTERNATE_SSL: If you are not using HTTPS or WSS for WebSocket, or you are happy with the default implementation, you can disable the alretnate ssl handler.
-BESTHTTP_DISABLE_UNITY_FORM: You can remove the dependency on Unity's WWWForm.

Upgrading to 1.9.x:
In v1.9.0 all DLL dependencies are removed, and some of the files from the source too. So a clean install is advised: Before you install v1.9.x you have to remove the /Assets/Best HTTP (Pro)/ folder and TcpClientImplementation.dll from the /Assets/Plugins/, /Assets/Plugins/Metro and /Assets/Plugins/WP8 folders.
